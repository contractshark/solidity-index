Please always test your code before you use it, unfortunately, we can never guarantee 100% correctness.\r\n\r\nWe are especially grateful about the many voluntary community contributions this release received.\r\nTwo fearless individuals dived deep into the solidity code and delivered two major features: Thanks a lot to @VoR0220 for the inline arrays and to @guanqun for the ternary operator!\r\nFurthermore, @bobsummerwill spent a lot of free time handling build issues on MacOS and other platforms.\r\nOther contributions came from @axic, @chfast, @ethers, @janx, @pipermerriam and @u2.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- **Inline arrays**, i.e. `var y = [1,x,f()];` if there is a common type for `1`, `x` and `f()`. Note that the result is always a fixed-length memory array and conversion to dynamic-length memory arrays is not yet possible.\r\n- **Import** similar to ECMAScript6 import (`import \"abc.sol\" as d` and `import {x, y} from \"abc.sol\"`). [Documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/layout-of-source-files.html#importing-other-source-files) \r\n- Commandline compiler solc automatically resolves missing imports and allows for \"include directories\". [Documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/layout-of-source-files.html#use-in-actual-compilers)\r\n- **Conditional** / ternary operator: `x ? y : z`\r\n\r\nFixed bugs:\r\n- Several bugs where the optimizer generated invalid code.\r\n- Enums and structs were not accessible to other contracts.\r\n- Fixed segfault connected to function paramater types, appeared during gas estimation.\r\n- Type checker crash for wrong number of base constructor parameters.\r\n- Allow function overloads with different array types.\r\n- Allow assignments of type `(x) = 7`.\r\n- Type `uint176` was not available.\r\n- Fixed crash during type checking concerning constructor calls.\r\n- Fixed crash during code generation concerning invalid accessors for struct types.\r\n- Fixed crash during code generating concerning computing a hash of a struct type.\r\n\r\nnote: The source below cannot be used without the dependent repositories.\r\n"

                      "description": "**Note:** Version 0.4.0 is unable to compile libraries. Please upgrade to 0.4.1.\n\nThis release deliberately breaks backwards compatibility mostly to enforce some safety features. The most important change is that you have to explicitly specify if functions can receive ether via the `payable` modifier. Furthermore, more situations cause exceptions to be thrown.\n\nMinimal changes to be made for upgrade:\n- Add `payable` to all functions that want to receive Ether (including the constructor and the fallback function).\n- Change `_` to `_;` in modifiers.\n- Add version pragma to each file: `pragma solidity ^0.4.0;`\n\nBreaking Changes:\n- Source files have to specify the compiler version they are compatible with using e.g. `pragma solidity ^0.4.0;` or\n  `pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.4.8;`\n- Functions that want to receive Ether have to specify the\n  new `payable` modifier (otherwise they throw).\n- Contracts that want to receive Ether with a plain \"send\"\n  have to implement a fallback function with the `payable`\n  modifier. Contracts now throw if no payable fallback\n  function is defined and no function matches the signature.\n- Failing contract creation through \"new\" throws.\n- Division / modulus by zero throws.\n- Function call throws if target contract does not have code\n- Modifiers are required to contain `_` (use `if (false) _` as a workaround if needed).\n- Modifiers: return does not skip part in modifier after `_`.\n- Placeholder statement `_` in modifier now requires explicit `;`.\n- `ecrecover` now returns zero if the input is malformed (it previously returned garbage).\n- The `constant` keyword cannot be used for constructors or the fallback function.\n- Removed `--interface` (Solidity interface) output option\n- JSON AST: General cleanup, renamed many nodes to match their C++ names.\n- JSON output: `srcmap-runtime` renamed to `srcmapRuntime`.\n- Moved (and reworked) standard library contracts from inside the compiler to github.com/ethereum/solidity/std\n  (`import \"std\";` or `import owned;` do not work anymore).\n- Confusing and undocumented keyword `after` was removed.\n- New reserved words: `abstract`, `hex`, `interface`, `payable`, `pure`, `static`, `view`.\n\nFeatures:\n- Hexadecimal string literals: `hex\"ab1248fe\"`\n- Internal: Inline assembly usable by the code generator.\n- Commandline interface: Using `-` as filename allows reading from stdin.\n- Interface JSON: Fallback function is now part of the ABI.\n- Interface: Version string now _semver_ compatible.\n- Code generator: Do not provide \"new account gas\" if we know the called account exists.\n\nBugfixes:\n- JSON AST: Nodes were added at wrong parent\n- Why3 translator: Crash fix for exponentiation\n- Commandline Interface: linking libraries with underscores in their name.\n- Type Checker: Fallback function cannot return data anymore.\n- Code Generator: Fix crash when `sha3()` was used on unsupported types.\n- Code Generator: Manually set gas stipend for `.send(0)`.\n\nLots of changes to the documentation mainly by voluntary external contributors.\n"

The most important fix concerns the optimizer which generated invalid code connected to the `SHA3` opcode in certain situations.\n\nFeatures:\n- Inline assembly: support both `suicide` and `selfdestruct` opcodes\n  (note: `suicide` is deprecated).\n- Inline assembly: issue warning if stack is not balanced after block.\n- Include `keccak256()` as an alias to `sha3()`.\n- Support shifting constant numbers.\n\nBugfixes:\n- Commandline interface: Disallow unknown options in `solc`.\n- Name resolver: Allow inheritance of `enum` definitions.\n- Type checker: Proper type checking for bound functions.\n- Type checker: fixed crash related to invalid fixed point constants\n- Type checker: fixed crash related to invalid literal numbers.\n- Type checker: `super.x` does not look up `x` in the current contract.\n- Code generator: expect zero stack increase after `super` as an expression.\n- Code generator: fix an internal compiler error for `L.Foo` for `enum Foo` defined in library `L`.\n- Code generator: allow inheritance of `enum` definitions.\n- Inline assembly: support the `address` opcode.\n- Inline assembly: fix parsing of assignment after a label.\n- Inline assembly: external variables of unsupported type (such as `this`, `super`, etc.)\n  are properly detected as unusable.\n- Inline assembly: support variables within modifiers.\n- Optimizer: fix related to stale knowledge about SHA3 operations\n"

The second is a security fix: In extremely specific circumstances, it can happen that a regular function is called instead of the fallback function for an Ether transfer without data. These circumstances are: The function has to have a zero signature (one out of 4294967296), it has to be payable, the contract cannot have more than five (external) functions and it cannot have a fallback function.\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n * Code Generator: Always use all available gas for calls as experimental 0.5.0 feature\r\n   (previously, some amount was retained in order to work in pre-Tangerine-Whistle\r\n   EVM versions)\r\n * Parser: Better error message for unexpected trailing comma in parameter lists.\r\n * Standard JSON: Support the ``outputSelection`` field for selective compilation of supplied sources.\r\n * Syntax Checker: Unary ``+`` is now a syntax error as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow non-pure constant state variables as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Type Checker: Do not add members of ``address`` to contracts as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Type Checker: Force interface functions to be external as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Type Checker: Require ``storage`` or ``memory`` keyword for local variables as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Allocate one byte per memory byte array element instead of 32.\r\n * Code Generator: Do not accept data with less than four bytes (truncated function\r\n   signature) for regular function calls - fallback function is invoked instead.\r\n * Optimizer: Remove unused stack computation results.\r\n * Parser: Fix source location of VariableDeclarationStatement.\r\n * Type Checker: Allow ``gas`` in view functions.\r\n * Type Checker: Do not mark event parameters as shadowing state variables.\r\n * Type Checker: Prevent duplicate event declarations.\r\n * Type Checker: Properly check array length and don't rely on an assertion in code generation.\r\n * Type Checker: Properly support overwriting members inherited from ``address`` in a contract\r\n   (such as ``balance``, ``transfer``, etc.)\r\n * Type Checker: Validate each number literal in tuple expressions even if they are not assigned from.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all our open source community contributors:\r\n\r\nbenjaminion, bernard peh, Boris Kostenko, Dave Hoover, David Au, Federico Bond, Gianfranco Cecconi, Giovanni Casinelli, Ilya Drabenia, Martín Triay, Rhett Aultman, Sergiusz Bazanski, wadeAlexC, Walter Weinmann and Zetherz.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.4.18.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly."

One of them is the new ABI decoder, which is still in experimental mode, but will hopefully be production-usable soon. External contributions like allowing constant variables for array lengths and improved error messages should make your life as a programmer easier. Finally, the standard-json-io-system now allows to select certain artifacts from a contract which should speed up your code-compile-test-cycle even more!\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n * Code Generator: New ABI decoder which supports structs and arbitrarily nested\r\n   arrays and checks input size (activate using ``pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;``).\r\n * General: Allow constant variables to be used as array length.\r\n * Inline Assembly: ``if`` statement.\r\n * Standard JSON: Support the ``outputSelection`` field for selective compilation of target artifacts.\r\n * Syntax Checker: Turn the usage of ``callcode`` into an error as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Type Checker: Improve address checksum warning.\r\n * Type Checker: More detailed errors for invalid array lengths (such as division by zero).\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all our open source community contributors:\r\n\r\nBalajiganapathi S, Boris Kostenko, Christian Pamidov, Chua Chee Wee, Ezra Epstein, Federico Bond, Francisco Giordano, Guanqun Lu, Isaac van Bakel, Jared Wasinger, Kwang Yul Seo, Liana Husikyan, Sami Mäkel Svetlin Nakov, William Morriss, rivenhk, wadeAlexC, walter-weinmann and wbt.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.4.19.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly.\r\n\r\n"

In this release, this pragma does not generate a warning anymore, so you can (and should) use it in production code.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, you can now specify which EVM version the contract should be compiled for. Valid values are \"homestead\", \"tangerineWhistle\", \"spuriousDragon\", \"byzantium\" (the default) and \"constantinople\". Depending on this setting, different opcodes will be used in some cases. The only place where this is currently used by default is that all gas is forwarded with calls starting from \"tangerineWhistle\" (in homestead, some gas has to be retained for the ``call`` opcode itself). Also, the gas estimator reports different costs for the opcodes depending on the version and thus the optimizer might generate different code.\r\n\r\nThe new \"0.5.0\" features are explained in more detail below the list of features and bugfixes.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.4.21.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n\r\n * Code Generator: Assert that ``k != 0`` for ``mulmod(a, b, k)`` and ``addmod(a, b, k)`` as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Code Generator: Do not retain any gas in calls (except if EVM version is set to homestead).\r\n * Code Generator: Use ``STATICCALL`` opcode for calling ``view`` and ``pure`` functions as experimenal 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * General: C99/C++-style scoping rules (instead of JavaScript function scoping) take effect as experimental v0.5.0 feature.\r\n * General: Improved messaging when error spans multiple lines of a sourcefile\r\n * General: Support and recommend using ``emit EventName();`` to call events explicitly.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Enforce strict mode as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Interface: Provide ability to select target EVM version (homestead or byzantium, with byzantium being the default).\r\n * Standard JSON: Reject badly formatted invalid JSON inputs.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow uninitialized storage pointers as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Syntax Analyser: Do not warn about experimental features if they do not concern code generation.\r\n * Syntax Analyser: Do not warn about ``pragma experimental \"v0.5.0\"`` and do not set the experimental flag in the bytecode for this.\r\n * Syntax Checker: Mark ``throw`` as an error as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Syntax Checker: Issue error if no visibility is specified on contract functions as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Syntax Checker: Issue warning when using overloads of ``address`` on contract instances.\r\n * Type Checker: disallow combining hex numbers and unit denominations as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n\r\n * Assembly: Raise error on oversized number literals in assembly.\r\n * JSON-AST: Add \"documentation\" property to function, event and modifier definition.\r\n * Resolver: Properly determine shadowing for imports with aliases.\r\n * Standalone Assembly: Do not ignore input after closing brace of top level block.\r\n * Standard JSON: Catch errors properly when invalid \"sources\" are passed.\r\n * Standard JSON: Ensure that library addresses supplied are of correct length and hex prefixed.\r\n * Type Checker: Properly detect which array and struct types are unsupported by the old ABI encoder.\r\n * Type Checker: Properly warn when using ``_offset`` and ``_slot`` for constants in inline assembly.\r\n * Commandline interface: throw error if option is unknown\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all our open source community contributors:\r\n\r\nAlexander Arlt, Dax Bondye, Emilio Almansi, Evgeny Medvedev, Federico Bond, Hongbin Zuo, Oleksii Matiiasevych, Raghav Dua, William Entriken, bernard peh, Aaron Colaço, Alexandre Bezroutchko, Anthony Broad-Crawford, DYLAN BECKWITH, Elena Dimitrova, Furkan Ayhan, Jordi Baylina, Li Xuanji, Zhen Zhang, ankit raj, janat08, mirgj, wbt.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Details:**\r\n\r\n * Code Generator: Use ``STATICCALL`` opcode for calling ``view`` and ``pure`` functions as experimenal 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that functions marked as ``view`` or ``pure`` (previously ``constant``) cannot modify the state. This is especially important if you call unknown code via a generic interface and you cannot be sure whether the function modifies the state or not. This way, ``view`` and ``pure`` functions cannot have reentrancy effects.\r\n\r\n * General: C99/C++-style scoping rules (instead of JavaScript function scoping) take effect as experimental v0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nVariables are no longer valid in the whole function and even before they were declared as in JavaScript, but instead only in the ``{``/``}``-enclosed block where they are declared and only starting after their declaration. These are the rules also used by C++ or Java. There is a common exception where variables declared in the initializing part of the ``for`` header are also valid in the rest of the ``for`` loop construct which we also use in Solidity. Currently, the stack slot reserved for the variable still spans the whole function, but this is planned to be improved for the next release.\r\n\r\n * General: Support and recommend using ``emit EventName();`` to call events explicitly.\r\n\r\nIn order to make events stand out with regards to regular function calls, ``emit EventName()`` as opposed to just ``EventName()`` should now be used to \"call\" events.\r\n\r\n * Inline Assembly: Enforce strict mode as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nStrict mode disallows labels, jumps and opcodes that directly modify the stack. It is much safer than non-strict mode, since you do not have to keep track of the current state of the stack. Furthermore, it allows an optimizer stage (to be finished soon) to be created much more easily. Because of that, the optimizer will refuse to work on non-strict assembly.\r\n\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow uninitialized storage pointers as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nStorage pointers (e.g. ``StructType storage x;``) can lead to severe storage corruption if used without being assigned. In 0.5.0 it will be illegal to declare a storage pointer without directly initializing it.\r\n\r\n * Syntax Checker: Mark ``throw`` as an error as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nThe ``throw`` keyword creates the impression that exceptions are a feature of Solidity, while in reality, it only supports state-reversion that can soon also include error data. Because of that, ``throw`` is deprecated.\r\n\r\n * Syntax Checker: Issue error if no visibility is specified on contract functions as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nSince there were bugs where people did not realize that the default visibility of functions is ``public``, specifying a visibility was made mandatory.\r\n\r\n * Syntax Checker: Issue warning when using overloads of ``address`` on contract instances.\r\n\r\nCollisions between native members of the ``address`` type and user-defined members of contracts can easily deceive users. Because of that, address members are no longer available in contracts. If you want to use an address member (``transfer`` is one of them!), then convert it to address: ``address(contractInstance).transfer(2 wei)``.\r\n\r\n * Type Checker: disallow combining hex numbers and unit denominations as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nWe could not think of any situation where unit denominations like ``seconds`` or ``ether`` combined with hexadecimal literals would be meaningful (``0x1234 ether`` or ``0x20 minutes``) and thus deprecated this combination."

Also, the gas estimator reports different costs for the opcodes depending on the version and thus the optimizer might generate different code.\r\n\r\nThe new \"0.5.0\" features are explained in more detail below the list of features and bugfixes.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.4.21.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n\r\n * Code Generator: Assert that ``k != 0`` for ``mulmod(a, b, k)`` and ``addmod(a, b, k)`` as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Code Generator: Do not retain any gas in calls (except if EVM version is set to homestead).\r\n * Code Generator: Use ``STATICCALL`` opcode for calling ``view`` and ``pure`` functions as experimenal 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * General: C99/C++-style scoping rules (instead of JavaScript function scoping) take effect as experimental v0.5.0 feature.\r\n * General: Improved messaging when error spans multiple lines of a sourcefile\r\n * General: Support and recommend using ``emit EventName();`` to call events explicitly.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Enforce strict mode as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Interface: Provide ability to select target EVM version (homestead or byzantium, with byzantium being the default).\r\n * Standard JSON: Reject badly formatted invalid JSON inputs.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow uninitialized storage pointers as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Syntax Analyser: Do not warn about experimental features if they do not concern code generation.\r\n * Syntax Analyser: Do not warn about ``pragma experimental \"v0.5.0\"`` and do not set the experimental flag in the bytecode for this.\r\n * Syntax Checker: Mark ``throw`` as an error as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Syntax Checker: Issue error if no visibility is specified on contract functions as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n * Syntax Checker: Issue warning when using overloads of ``address`` on contract instances.\r\n * Type Checker: disallow combining hex numbers and unit denominations as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n\r\n * Assembly: Raise error on oversized number literals in assembly.\r\n * JSON-AST: Add \"documentation\" property to function, event and modifier definition.\r\n * Resolver: Properly determine shadowing for imports with aliases.\r\n * Standalone Assembly: Do not ignore input after closing brace of top level block.\r\n * Standard JSON: Catch errors properly when invalid \"sources\" are passed.\r\n * Standard JSON: Ensure that library addresses supplied are of correct length and hex prefixed.\r\n * Type Checker: Properly detect which array and struct types are unsupported by the old ABI encoder.\r\n * Type Checker: Properly warn when using ``_offset`` and ``_slot`` for constants in inline assembly.\r\n * Commandline interface: throw error if option is unknown\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all our open source community contributors:\r\n\r\nAlexander Arlt, Dax Bondye, Emilio Almansi, Evgeny Medvedev, Federico Bond, Hongbin Zuo, Oleksii Matiiasevych, Raghav Dua, William Entriken, bernard peh, Aaron Colaço, Alexandre Bezroutchko, Anthony Broad-Crawford, DYLAN BECKWITH, Elena Dimitrova, Furkan Ayhan, Jordi Baylina, Li Xuanji, Zhen Zhang, ankit raj, janat08, mirgj, wbt.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Details:**\r\n\r\n * Code Generator: Use ``STATICCALL`` opcode for calling ``view`` and ``pure`` functions as experimenal 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that functions marked as ``view`` or ``pure`` (previously ``constant``) cannot modify the state. This is especially important if you call unknown code via a generic interface and you cannot be sure whether the function modifies the state or not. This way, ``view`` and ``pure`` functions cannot have reentrancy effects.\r\n\r\n * General: C99/C++-style scoping rules (instead of JavaScript function scoping) take effect as experimental v0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nVariables are no longer valid in the whole function and even before they were declared as in JavaScript, but instead only in the ``{``/``}``-enclosed block where they are declared and only starting after their declaration. These are the rules also used by C++ or Java. There is a common exception where variables declared in the initializing part of the ``for`` header are also valid in the rest of the ``for`` loop construct which we also use in Solidity. Currently, the stack slot reserved for the variable still spans the whole function, but this is planned to be improved for the next release.\r\n\r\n * General: Support and recommend using ``emit EventName();`` to call events explicitly.\r\n\r\nIn order to make events stand out with regards to regular function calls, ``emit EventName()`` as opposed to just ``EventName()`` should now be used to \"call\" events.\r\n\r\n * Inline Assembly: Enforce strict mode as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nStrict mode disallows labels, jumps and opcodes that directly modify the stack. It is much safer than non-strict mode, since you do not have to keep track of the current state of the stack. Furthermore, it allows an optimizer stage (to be finished soon) to be created much more easily. Because of that, the optimizer will refuse to work on non-strict assembly.\r\n\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow uninitialized storage pointers as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nStorage pointers (e.g. ``StructType storage x;``) can lead to severe storage corruption if used without being assigned. In 0.5.0 it will be illegal to declare a storage pointer without directly initializing it.\r\n\r\n * Syntax Checker: Mark ``throw`` as an error as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nThe ``throw`` keyword creates the impression that exceptions are a feature of Solidity, while in reality, it only supports state-reversion that can soon also include error data. Because of that, ``throw`` is deprecated.\r\n\r\n * Syntax Checker: Issue error if no visibility is specified on contract functions as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nSince there were bugs where people did not realize that the default visibility of functions is ``public``, specifying a visibility was made mandatory.\r\n\r\n * Syntax Checker: Issue warning when using overloads of ``address`` on contract instances.\r\n\r\nCollisions between native members of the ``address`` type and user-defined members of contracts can easily deceive users. Because of that, address members are no longer available in contracts. If you want to use an address member (``transfer`` is one of them!), then convert it to address: ``address(contractInstance).transfer(2 wei)``.\r\n\r\n * Type Checker: disallow combining hex numbers and unit denominations as experimental 0.5.0 feature.\r\n\r\nWe could not think of any situation where unit denominations like ``seconds`` or ``ether`` combined with hexadecimal literals would be meaningful (``0x1234 ether`` or ``0x20 minutes``) and thus deprecated this combination."

Must configure it with CMake as `-DLLL=ON`.\r\n * Docker: Includes both Scratch and Alpine images.\r\n * Emscripten: Upgrade to Emscripten SDK 1.37.21 and boost 1.67.\r\n\r\n**Solc-Js:**\r\n * Fix handling of standard-json in the commandline executable.\r\n * Remove support of nodejs 4.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlbert, Alex Beregszaszi, Anurag Dashputre, Chris Purta, Christian Parpart, Chris Ward, Daniel Kirchner, David Lozano Jarque, Erik Kundt, hydai, Javier Tarazaga, Justin Wilson, Lazaridis, Leonardo Alt, liangdzou, mordax, Robert Chung, William Entriken, Yet another codejunkie\r\n"

                      "description": "This release adds support for accessing the code of a contract type, which will hopefully make the new `CREATE2` opcode easier to use. We also added some static analysis features to the compiler, but most changes were done \"under the hood\" to pave the way for using the new Yul-based optimizer with ABIEncoderV2.\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Provide access to creation and runtime code of contracts via ``type(C).creationCode`` / ``type(C).runtimeCode``.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Control Flow Graph: Warn about unreachable code.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support basic typecasts without truncation.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support external function calls and erase all knowledge regarding storage variables and references.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Emscripten: Split simplification rule initialization up further to work around issues with soljson.js in some browsers.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow calldata structs until implemented.\r\n * Type Checker: Return type error if fixed point encoding is attempted instead of throwing ``UnimplementedFeatureError``.\r\n * Yul: Check that arguments to ``dataoffset`` and ``datasize`` are literals at parse time and properly take this into account in the optimizer.\r\n * Yul: Parse number literals for detecting duplicate switch cases.\r\n * Yul: Require switch cases to have the same type.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Emscripten: Upgrade to emscripten 1.38.8 on travis and circleci.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.5.3.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, androlo, Asher, chandan kumar mandal, Christian Parpart, Chris Ward, Daniel Kirchner, Erik Kundt, Evan Saulpaugh, Leonardo Alt, Nick Barry, Paweł Bylica, poiresel, spmvg, Tomek Kopczynski, William Entriken\r\n"

For details about the bug, please see the [official announcement](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/03/26/solidity-optimizer-and-abiencoderv2-bug/).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this release also allows you to use Yul as a language option (instead of \"Solidity\") in the [standard-json-interface](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.7/using-the-compiler.html#compiler-input-and-output-json-description).\r\n\r\n**Important Bugfixes:**\r\n * ABIEncoderV2: Fix bugs related to loading short value types from storage when encoding an array or struct from storage.\r\n * ABIEncoderV2: Fix buffer overflow problem when encoding packed array from storage.\r\n * Optimizer: Fix wrong ordering of arguments in byte optimization rule for constants.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Function calls with named arguments now work with overloaded functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Inline Assembly: Issue error when using ``callvalue()`` inside nonpayable function (in the same way that ``msg.value`` already does).\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Support \"Yul\" as input language.\r\n * SMTChecker: Show callstack together with model if applicable.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support modifiers.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Enable stack allocation optimization by default if Yul optimizer is active (disable in ``yulDetails``).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Defensively pad memory for ``type(Contract).name`` to multiples of 32.\r\n * Type System: Detect and disallow internal function pointers as parameters for public/external library functions, even when they are nested/wrapped in structs, arrays or other types.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Properly determine whether a variable can be eliminated during stack compression pass.\r\n * Yul / Inline Assembly Parser: Disallow more than one case statement with the same label inside a switch based on the label's integer value.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Install scripts: Fix boost repository URL for CentOS 6.\r\n * Soltest: Fix hex string update in soltest.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, Bhargava Shastry, Christian Parpart, Chris Ward, Constantin Kloecker, Daniel Kirchner, Erik Kundt, Leonardo Alt, Mathias Baumann, SystemGlitch, Taariq Levack\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.5.7.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly."

This affected code generation.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix SSA transform for multi-assignments.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * ABIEncoderV2: Implement encoding of calldata arrays and structs.\r\n * Code Generation: Implement copying recursive structs from storage to memory.\r\n * Yul: Disallow function definitions inside for-loop init blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * ABI Decoder: Raise a runtime error on dirty inputs when using the experimental decoder.\r\n * Optimizer: Add rule for shifts by constants larger than 255 for Constantinople.\r\n * Optimizer: Add rule to simplify certain ANDs and SHL combinations\r\n * SMTChecker: Support arithmetic compound assignment operators.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support unary increment and decrement for array and mapping access.\r\n * SMTChecker: Show unsupported warning for inline assembly blocks.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support mod.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support ``contract`` type.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support ``this`` as address.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support address members.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Metadata settings now re-produce the original ``\"useLiteralContent\"`` setting from the compilation input.\r\n * Yul: Adds break and continue keywords to for-loop syntax.\r\n * Yul: Support ``.`` as part of identifiers.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Adds steps for detecting and removing of dead code.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * SMTChecker: Implement Boolean short-circuiting.\r\n * SMTChecker: SSA control-flow did not take into account state variables that were modified inside inlined functions that were called inside branches.\r\n * Type System: Allow direct call to base class functions that have overloads.\r\n * Yul: Properly register functions and disallow shadowing between function variables and variables in the outside scope.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Build System:**\r\n * Soltest: Add commandline option `--test` / `-t` to isoltest which takes a string that allows filtering unit tests.\r\n * soltest.sh: allow environment variable ``SOLIDITY_BUILD_DIR`` to specify build folder and add ``--help`` usage.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, Bhargava Shastry, Christian Parpart, Chris Ward, Constantin Kloecker, Daniel Kirchner, dm4, Erik Kundt, fnatic, Grant Wuerker, hydai, Ilya Ostrovskiy, Leonardo Alt, Mathias Baumann, mingchuan, rocky, William Entriken\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.5.8.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly."

Finally, Yul and web assembly support are progressing.\r\n\r\nWe also improved our testing framework which now allows for semantics tests to run in 4 seconds instead of 1 minute.\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Inline Assembly: Support direct constants of value type in inline assembly.\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * ABI: Additional internal type info in the field ``internalType``.\r\n * eWasm: Highly experimental eWasm output using ``--ewasm`` in the commandline interface or output selection of ``ewasm.wast`` in standard-json.\r\n * Metadata: Update the swarm hash to the current specification, changes ``bzzr0`` to ``bzzr1`` and urls to use ``bzz-raw://``.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Compile only selected sources and contracts.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Provide secondary error locations (e.g. the source position of other conflicting declarations).\r\n * SMTChecker: Do not erase knowledge about storage pointers if another storage pointer is assigned.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support string literal type.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Provide AST even on errors if ``--error-recovery`` commandline switch or StandardCompiler `settings.parserErrorRecovery` is true.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Do not inline function if it would result in expressions being duplicated that are not cheap.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * ABI decoder: Ensure that decoded arrays always point to distinct memory locations.\r\n * Code Generator: Treat dynamically encoded but statically sized arrays and structs in calldata properly.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when inlining functions that contain tuple expressions.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix pointer knowledge erasing in loops.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using compound bitwise assignment operators inside branches.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when inlining a function that returns a tuple containing an unsupported type inside a branch.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when inlining functions that use state variables and belong to a different source.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when reporting counterexamples concerning state variables from different source files.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix SMT sort mismatch when using string literals.\r\n * View/Pure Checker: Properly detect state variable access through base class.\r\n * Yul Analyzer: Check availability of data objects already in analysis phase.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix an issue where memory-accessing code was removed even though ``msize`` was used in the program.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, Bhargava Shastry, cgrigis, Chris Chinchilla, Chris Smith, Christian Parpart, Daniel Kirchner, djudjuu, dm4, Erik Kundt, Leonardo Alt, Mathias Baumann, mingchuan, Nimish Bongale, Rocky Bernstein (supported by ConsenSys), William Entriken.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.5.11.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly."

As with all other releases, the coverage of the SMT checker is further improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Allow to obtain the address of a linked library with ``address(LibraryName)``.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * Code Generator: Use SELFBALANCE opcode for ``address(this).balance`` if using Istanbul EVM.\r\n * EWasm: Experimental EWasm binary output via ``--ewasm`` and as documented in standard-json.\r\n * SMTChecker: Add break/continue support to the CHC engine.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support assignments to multi-dimensional arrays and mappings.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support inheritance and function overriding.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Output the storage layout of a contract when artifact ``storageLayout`` is requested.\r\n * TypeChecker: List possible candidates when overload resolution fails.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Code Generator: Fixed a faulty assert that would wrongly trigger for array sizes exceeding unsigned integer.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when accessing indices of fixed bytes.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using function pointers as arguments.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when implicitly converting string literals to fixed bytes.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow constructor of the same class to be used as modifier.\r\n * Type Checker: Treat magic variables as unknown identifiers in inline assembly.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, Alexander Arlt, Bhargava Shastry, Chris Chinchilla, Christian Parpart, Daniel Kirchner, Erik Kundt, Gaith Hallak, hellraiserinchief , Henry Lee, Jochem Brouwer, Leonardo Alt, Mathias Baumann\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.5.13.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly."

                      "description": "This is a major breaking release of the Solidity compiler and language. Changes include explicit virtual and override keywords in inheritance, support for try/catch, splitting the fallback function into a receive Ether function and an actual fallback function and limitations on how the length of an array can be changed, among others. For a detailed explanation, please see the [documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/060-breaking-changes.html) or refer to the list below that shows every single change.\r\n\r\nFrom this release on, ABIEncoderV2 is not considered experimental any more, but you still have to activate it through the pragma.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Yul optimizer is automatically activated together with the regular optimizer, but you can still disable it through the detailed optimizer settings.\r\n\r\n**Breaking changes:**\r\n * ABI: Remove the deprecated ``constant`` and ``payable`` fields.\r\n * ABI: The ``type`` field is now required and no longer specified to default to ``function``.\r\n * AST: Inline assembly is exported as structured JSON instead of plain string.\r\n * C API (``libsolc``): Introduce context parameter to both ``solidity_compile`` and the callback.\r\n * C API (``libsolc``): The provided callback now takes two parameters, kind and data. The callback can then be used for multiple purposes, such has file imports and SMT queries.\r\n * C API (``libsolc``): ``solidity_free`` was renamed to ``solidity_reset``. Functions ``solidity_alloc`` and ``solidity_free`` were added.\r\n * C API (``libsolc``): ``solidity_compile`` now returns a string that must be explicitly freed via ``solidity_free()``\r\n * Commandline Interface: Remove the text-based AST printer (``--ast``).\r\n * Commandline Interface: Switch to the new error reporter by default. ``--old-reporter`` falls back to the deprecated old error reporter.\r\n * Commandline Interface: Add option to disable or choose hash method between IPFS and Swarm for the bytecode metadata.\r\n * General: Disallow explicit conversions from external function types to ``address`` and add a member called ``address`` to them as replacement.\r\n * General: Enable Yul optimizer as part of standard optimization.\r\n * General: New reserved keywords: ``override``, ``receive``, and ``virtual``.\r\n * General: ``private`` cannot be used together with ``virtual``.\r\n * General: Split unnamed fallback functions into two cases defined using ``fallback()`` and ``receive()``.\r\n * Inheritance: State variable shadowing is now disallowed.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Only strict inline assembly is allowed.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Variable declarations cannot shadow declarations outside the assembly block.\r\n * JSON AST: Replace ``superFunction`` attribute by ``baseFunctions``.\r\n * Natspec JSON Interface: Properly support multiple ``@return`` statements in ``@dev`` documentation and enforce named return parameters to be mentioned in the documentation.\r\n * Source mappings: Add \"modifier depth\" as a fifth field in the source mappings.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Add option to disable or choose hash method between IPFS and Swarm for the bytecode metadata.\r\n * Syntax: ``push(element)`` for dynamic storage arrays do not return the new length anymore.\r\n * Syntax: Abstract contracts need to be marked explicitly as abstract by using the ``abstract`` keyword.\r\n * Syntax: ``length`` member of arrays is now always read-only, even for storage arrays.\r\n * Type Checker: Resulting type of exponentiation is equal to the type of the base.

While ``solidity-upgrade`` carries out a large part of the work, your contracts will most likely need further manual adjustments.\r\n\r\nYou can find a guide on how to update your code [here](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/070-breaking-changes.html#how-to-update-your-code).\r\n\r\nNote that changes listed below are the **changes between 0.6.12 and 0.7.0**. For changes introduced\r\nduring the 0.6.x series, please see the individual changelogs or release announcements on this blog.\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes:**\r\n * Inline Assembly: Disallow ``.`` in user-defined function and variable names.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Slot and offset of storage pointer variable ``x`` are accessed via ``x.slot`` and ``x.offset`` instead of ``x_slot`` and ``x_offset``.\r\n * JSON AST: Mark hex string literals with ``kind: \"hexString\"``.\r\n * JSON AST: Remove members with ``null`` value from JSON output.\r\n * Parser: Disallow ``gwei`` as identifier.\r\n * Parser: Disallow dot syntax for ``value`` and ``gas``.\r\n * Parser: Disallow non-printable characters in string literals.\r\n * Parser: Introduce Unicode string literals: ``unicode\"😃\"``.\r\n * Parser: NatSpec comments on variables are only allowed for public state variables.\r\n * Parser: Remove the ``finney`` and ``szabo`` denominations.\r\n * Parser: Remove the identifier ``now`` (replaced by ``block.timestamp``).\r\n * Reference Resolver: ``using A for B`` only affects the contract it is mentioned in and not all derived contracts\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow ``virtual`` for library functions.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow assignments to state variables that contain nested mappings.\r\n * Type checker: Disallow events with same name and parameter types in inheritance hierarchy.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow shifts by signed types.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow structs and arrays in memory or calldata if they contain nested mappings.\r\n * Type Checker: Exponentiation and shifts of literals by non-literals will always use ``uint256`` or ``int256`` as a type.\r\n * Yul: Disallow consecutive and trailing dots in identifiers. Leading dots were already disallowed.\r\n * Yul: Disallow EVM instruction `pc()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Inheritance: Allow overrides to have stricter state mutability: ``view`` can override ``nonpayable`` and ``pure`` can override ``view``.\r\n * Parser: Deprecate visibility for constructors.\r\n * State mutability: Do not issue recommendation for stricter mutability for virtual functions but do issue it for functions that override.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * SMTChecker: Report multi-transaction counterexamples including the function calls that initiate the transactions. This does not include concrete values for reference types and reentrant calls.\r\n * Variable declarations using the ``var`` keyword are not recognized anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Inheritance: Disallow public state variables overwriting ``pure`` functions.\r\n * NatSpec: Constructors and functions have consistent userdoc output.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when assigning to a 1-tuple.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when tuples have extra effectless parenthesis.\r\n * State Mutability: Constant public state variables are considered ``pure`` functions.\r\n * Type Checker: Fixing deduction issues on function types when function call has named arguments.\r\n * Immutables: Fix internal compiler error when immutables are not assigned.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\na3d4, Alex Beregszaszi, Alexander Arlt, Bhargava Shastry, Christian Parpart, Daniel Kirchner, Djordje Mijovic, Erik Kundt, franzihei, Harikrishnan Mulackal, Leonardo Alt, Mathias Baumann.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.7.0.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly."

For changes introduced\r\nduring the 0.6.x series, please see the individual changelogs or release announcements on this blog.\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes:**\r\n * Inline Assembly: Disallow ``.`` in user-defined function and variable names.\r\n * Inline Assembly: Slot and offset of storage pointer variable ``x`` are accessed via ``x.slot`` and ``x.offset`` instead of ``x_slot`` and ``x_offset``.\r\n * JSON AST: Mark hex string literals with ``kind: \"hexString\"``.\r\n * JSON AST: Remove members with ``null`` value from JSON output.\r\n * Parser: Disallow ``gwei`` as identifier.\r\n * Parser: Disallow dot syntax for ``value`` and ``gas``.\r\n * Parser: Disallow non-printable characters in string literals.\r\n * Parser: Introduce Unicode string literals: ``unicode\"😃\"``.\r\n * Parser: NatSpec comments on variables are only allowed for public state variables.\r\n * Parser: Remove the ``finney`` and ``szabo`` denominations.\r\n * Parser: Remove the identifier ``now`` (replaced by ``block.timestamp``).\r\n * Reference Resolver: ``using A for B`` only affects the contract it is mentioned in and not all derived contracts\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow ``virtual`` for library functions.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow assignments to state variables that contain nested mappings.\r\n * Type checker: Disallow events with same name and parameter types in inheritance hierarchy.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow shifts by signed types.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow structs and arrays in memory or calldata if they contain nested mappings.\r\n * Type Checker: Exponentiation and shifts of literals by non-literals will always use ``uint256`` or ``int256`` as a type.\r\n * Yul: Disallow consecutive and trailing dots in identifiers. Leading dots were already disallowed.\r\n * Yul: Disallow EVM instruction `pc()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Inheritance: Allow overrides to have stricter state mutability: ``view`` can override ``nonpayable`` and ``pure`` can override ``view``.\r\n * Parser: Deprecate visibility for constructors.\r\n * State mutability: Do not issue recommendation for stricter mutability for virtual functions but do issue it for functions that override.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * SMTChecker: Report multi-transaction counterexamples including the function calls that initiate the transactions. This does not include concrete values for reference types and reentrant calls.\r\n * Variable declarations using the ``var`` keyword are not recognized anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * Inheritance: Disallow public state variables overwriting ``pure`` functions.\r\n * NatSpec: Constructors and functions have consistent userdoc output.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when assigning to a 1-tuple.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when tuples have extra effectless parenthesis.\r\n * State Mutability: Constant public state variables are considered ``pure`` functions.\r\n * Type Checker: Fixing deduction issues on function types when function call has named arguments.\r\n * Immutables: Fix internal compiler error when immutables are not assigned.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\na3d4, Alex Beregszaszi, Alexander Arlt, Bhargava Shastry, Christian Parpart, Daniel Kirchner, Djordje Mijovic, Erik Kundt, franzihei, Harikrishnan Mulackal, Leonardo Alt, Mathias Baumann.\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.7.0.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly."

This is a way to define helper-functions that are independent of specific contracts which is much more natural than using internal library functions. Apart from this, the release contains many bugfixes.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Language Features:**\r\n * Allow function definitions outside of contracts, behaving much like internal library functions.\r\n * Code generator: Implementing copying structs from calldata to storage.\r\n\r\n**Compiler Features:**\r\n * SMTChecker: Add underflow and overflow as verification conditions in the CHC engine.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support bitwise or, xor and not operators.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support conditional operator.\r\n * Standard JSON Interface: Do not run EVM bytecode code generation, if only Yul IR or EWasm output is requested.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: LoopInvariantCodeMotion can move reading operations outside for-loops as long as the affected area is not modified inside the loop.\r\n * Yul: Report error when using non-string literals for ``datasize()``, ``dataoffset()``, ``linkersymbol()``, ``loadimmutable()``, ``setimmutable()``.\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n * AST: Remove ``null`` member values also when the compiler is used in standard-json-mode.\r\n * General: Allow `type(Contract).name` for abstract contracts and interfaces.\r\n * Immutables: Disallow assigning immutables more than once during their declaration.\r\n * Immutables: Properly treat complex assignment and increment/decrement as both reading and writing and thus disallow it everywhere for immutable variables.\r\n * Optimizer: Keep side-effects of ``x`` in ``byte(a, shr(b, x))`` even if the constants ``a`` and ``b`` would make the expression zero unconditionally. This optimizer rule is very hard if not impossible to trigger in a way that it can result in invalid code, though.\r\n * References Resolver: Fix internal bug when using constructor for library.\r\n * Scanner: Fix bug where whitespace would be allowed within the ``->`` token (e.g. ``function f() -   > x {}`` becomes invalid in inline assembly and Yul).\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error in BMC function inlining.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on array implicit conversion.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on fixed bytes index access.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on lvalue unary operators with tuples.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on tuple assignment.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on tuples of one element that have tuple type.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix soundness of array ``pop``.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow ``using for`` directive inside interfaces.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow signed literals as exponent in exponentiation operator.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow structs containing nested mapping in memory as parameters for library functions.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Ensure that Yul keywords are not mistakenly used by the NameDispenser and VarNameCleaners. The bug would manifest as uncompilable code.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Make function inlining order more resilient to whether or not unrelated source files are present.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\na3d4, Alex Beregszaszi, Alexander Arlt, Bhargava Shastry, cakesoft-omkar, Christian Parpart, Daniel Kirchner, Đorđe Mijović, Goh Chun Lin, hactrox, Harikrishnan Mulackal, Harry Altman, Jason Cobb, Kamil Śliwak, Leonardo Alt, Mathias Baumann.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.7.1.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly."

More details can be found in the [release announcement](https://solidity.ethereum.org/2020/10/19/solidity-0.7.4-release-announcement/).\r\n\r\n### Important Bugfixes\r\n * Code Generator: Fix data corruption bug when copying empty byte arrays from memory or calldata to storage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Language Features\r\n * Constants can be defined at file level.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Compiler Features\r\n * Command Line Interface: New option ``--model-checker-engine`` allows to choose a specific SMTChecker engine. Options are ``all`` (default), ``bmc``, ``chc`` and ``none``.\r\n * Control Flow Graph: Print warning for non-empty functions with unnamed return parameters that are not assigned a value in all code paths.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support ``keccak256``, ``sha256``, ``ripemd160`` and ``ecrecover`` in the CHC engine.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support inline arrays.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support variables ``block``, ``msg`` and ``tx`` in the CHC engine.\r\n * Standard JSON: New option ``modelCheckerSettings.engine`` allows to choose a specific SMTChecker engine. Options are ``all`` (default), ``bmc``, ``chc`` and ``none``.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n * Code generator: Fix ``ABIEncoderV2`` pragma from the current module affecting inherited functions and applied modifiers.\r\n * Code generator: Fix internal compiler error when referencing members via module name but not using the reference.\r\n * Code generator: Fix internal error on returning structs containing mappings from library function.\r\n * Code generator: Use revert instead of invalid opcode for out-of-bounds array index access in getter.\r\n * Contract Level Checker: Add missing check against inheriting functions with ABIEncoderV2 return types in ABIEncoderV1 contracts.\r\n * Name Resolver: Fix shadowing/same-name warnings for later declarations.\r\n * Type Checker: Allow arrays of contract types as type expressions and as arguments for ``abi.decode``.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow invalid use of library names as type name.\r\n * Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error caused by storage parameters with nested mappings in libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\na3d4, Bhargava Shastry, Christian Parpart, Daniel Kirchner, Đorđe Mijović, franzihei, Harikrishnan Mulackal, Kamil Śliwak, Leonardo Alt, Martin Blicha, Mathias Baumann, Ronald Eddy Jr\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.7.4.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly."

For details, please see the [blog post](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2020/12/16/solidity-0.7.6-release-announcement).\r\n\r\n### Language Features:\r\n * Code generator: Support conversion from calldata slices to memory and storage arrays.\r\n * Code generator: Support copying dynamically encoded structs from calldata to memory.\r\n * Code generator: Support copying of nested arrays from calldata to memory.\r\n * Scanner: Generate a parser error when comments or unicode strings contain an unbalanced or underflowing set of unicode direction override markers (LRO, RLO, LRE, RLE, PDF).\r\n * The fallback function can now also have a single ``calldata`` argument (equaling ``msg.data``) and return ``bytes memory`` (which will not be ABI-encoded but returned as-is).\r\n * Wasm backend: Add ``i32.select`` and ``i64.select`` instructions.\r\n\r\n### Compiler Features:\r\n * Build System: Optionally support dynamic loading of Z3 and use that mechanism for Linux release builds.\r\n * Code Generator: Avoid memory allocation for default value if it is not used.\r\n * SMTChecker: Apply constant evaluation on binary arithmetic expressions.\r\n * SMTChecker: Create underflow and overflow verification targets for increment/decrement in the CHC engine.\r\n * SMTChecker: Report struct values in counterexamples from CHC engine.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support early returns in the CHC engine.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support getters.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support named arguments in function calls.\r\n * SMTChecker: Support struct constructor.\r\n * Standard-Json: Move the recently introduced ``modelCheckerSettings`` key to ``settings.modelChecker``.\r\n * Standard-Json: Properly filter the requested output artifacts.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes:\r\n * Code generator: Do not pad empty string literals with a single 32-byte zero field in the ABI coder v1.\r\n * NatSpec: Fix segfault when inheriting return parameter documentation for modifiers with no parameters.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix cast string literals to byte arrays.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal compiler error when doing bitwise compound assignment with string literals.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when trying to generate counterexamples with old z3.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix segmentation fault that could occur on certain SMT-enabled sources when no SMT solver was available.\r\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when ``bytes.push()`` is used as the LHS of an assignment.\r\n * Type Checker: ``super`` is not available in libraries.\r\n * Type Checker: Disallow leading zeroes in sized-types (e.g. ``bytes000032``), but allow them to be treated as identifiers.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix a bug in NameSimplifier where a new name created by NameSimplifier could also be created by NameDispenser.\r\n * Yul Optimizer: Removed NameSimplifier from optimization steps available to users.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, Alexander Arlt, Bhargava Shastry, Christian Parpart, Daniel Kirchner, Đorđe Mijović, franzihei, Harikrishnan Mulackal, Jaime, Kamil Śliwak, Leonardo Alt, Martin Blicha, Mathias Baumann, Matt Williams, midinas, ritzdorf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.7.6.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly."

Only the ``--ast-compact-json`` option is supported now.\r\n* General: Enable ABI coder v2 by default.\r\n* General: Remove global functions ``log0``, ``log1``, ``log2``, ``log3`` and ``log4``.\r\n* Parser: Exponentiation is right associative. ``a**b**c`` is parsed as ``a**(b**c)``.\r\n* Scanner: Remove support for the ``\\b``, ``\\f``, and ``\\v`` escape sequences.\r\n* Standard JSON: Remove the ``legacyAST`` option.\r\n* Type Checker: Function call options can only be given once.\r\n* Type System: Declarations with the name ``this``, ``super`` and ``_`` are disallowed, with the exception of public functions and events.\r\n* Type System: Disallow ``msg.data`` in ``receive()`` function.\r\n* Type System: Disallow ``type(super)``.\r\n* Type System: Disallow enums with more than 256 members.\r\n* Type System: Disallow explicit conversions from negative literals and literals larger than ``type(uint160).max`` to ``address`` type.\r\n* Type System: Disallow the ``byte`` type. It was an alias to ``bytes1``.\r\n* Type System: Explicit conversion to ``address`` type always returns a non-payable ``address`` type. In particular, ``address(u)``, ``address(b)``, ``address(c)`` and ``address(this)`` have the type ``address`` instead of ``address payable`` (Here ``u``, ``b``, and ``c`` are arbitrary variables of type ``uint160``, ``bytes20`` and contract type respectively.)\r\n* Type System: Explicit conversions between two types are disallowed if it changes more than one of sign, width or kind at the same time.\r\n* Type System: Explicit conversions from literals to enums are only allowed if the value fits in the enum.\r\n* Type System: Explicit conversions from literals to integer type is as strict as implicit conversions.\r\n* Type System: Introduce ``address(...).code`` to retrieve the code as ``bytes memory``. The size can be obtained via ``address(...).code.length``, but it will currently always include copying the code.\r\n* Type System: Introduce ``block.chainid`` for retrieving the current chain id.\r\n* Type System: Support ``address(...).codehash`` to retrieve the codehash of an account.\r\n* Type System: The global variables ``tx.origin`` and ``msg.sender`` have type ``address`` instead of ``address payable``.\r\n* Type System: Unary negation can only be used on signed integers, not on unsigned integers.\r\n* View Pure Checker: Mark ``chainid`` as view.\r\n* Yul: Disallow the use of reserved identifiers, such as EVM instructions, even if they are not available in the given dialect / EVM version.\r\n* Yul: The ``assignimmutable`` builtin in the \"EVM with objects\" dialect takes the base offset of the code to modify as an additional argument.\r\n\r\n### Language Features:\r\n* Super constructors can now be called using the member notation e.g. ``M.C(123)``.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes:\r\n* Type Checker: Perform proper truncating integer arithmetic when using constants in array length expressions.\r\n\r\n### AST Changes:\r\n* New AST Node ``IdentifierPath`` replacing in many places the ``UserDefinedTypeName``.\r\n* New AST Node ``UncheckedBlock`` used for ``unchecked { ... }``.\r\n\r\nWe especially thank all the contributors that made this release possible:\r\n\r\nAlex Beregszaszi, Christian Parpart, Daniel Kirchner, Djordje Mijovic, Harikrishnan Mulackal, Kamil Śliwak, Leonardo Alt, Mathias Baumann, ssi91\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to perform a source build, please only use solidity_0.8.0.tar.gz and not the zip provided by github directly.\r\n"
